  <h2>Things to avoid</h2>
  In general you want to avoid foods that are very fatty, acidic or contain large amounts of caffeine. Some commonly listed examples
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Coffee & black teas</strong> - caffeine free teas are generally ok</li>
    <li><strong>Chocolate</strong> - caffeine + fat + cocoa</li>
    <li><strong>Alcohol</strong> - relaxes the sphincter valve and promotes acid production</li>
    <li><strong>Oranges, grapefruit and other acidic fruits</strong> - high acid intake can relax the sphincter and worsen symptoms</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Habits</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Don't over eat</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Eat more small meals rather than a few large ones</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Don't eat right before bed</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Drink more water</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Exercise more</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Smoke less</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Don't wear tight clothes or belts</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Keep track</strong> - foods that aggravate Acid Reflux for others might be more tolerable for you and vice versa. Keep track of what works for you and what doesn't so you know what to avoid</li>
  </ul>
